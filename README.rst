Pyramid i18n HOWTO
==================

This repository is a tutorial about Pyramid Internationalization and
Localization, you can follow along the commits to see step by step
how to implement i18n into your web application.

This tutorial is the result of my experiments done while studying
Pyramid, a Python web application development framework, and it is a
practical how to, so I'm not going in deep with any explanation but
I invite you to read the references I used in order to have a better
understanding of Pyramid internationalization and localization.
